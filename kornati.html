                <h1>Kornati: A Kingdom of 89 Islands Where Nature Writes the Most Beautiful Poetry!</h1>
                <h2>NP Kornati</h2>
                <p class="description">Kornati islands</p> <br>
                <p>The most popular phenomenon in the park is the ‘crowns’, i.e. towering vertical cliffs facing the open sea which were created as a result of geological changes in the distant past. The crowns were created as a consequence of the tectonic movement of Africa towards the north and its crash into the European continent. It represents the surface extending from Istria to central Dalmatia. The highest cliff on Kornati islands is Klobučar (80 meters), followed by Mana (65 meters), Rašip Veliki (64 meters), Obručan (50 meters), and Piškera (45 meters). The deepest crown is also located on Piškera, plunging 90 meters deep into the sea.</p><br>
                <p>Another natural phenomenon on the Kornati boat tour is “Magazinova škrila”, also called “Ploča”, or “Vela ploča”. It sits below the highest peak of the Kornati, Metlina (237 meters), inclining towards the sea. Good starting points for visiting Magazinova Škrila are bays Kravjačica, Strižnja, or Vruje. This geological phenomenon attracts special attention to the numerous karst forms of Kornati. It is between 63 and 86 meters wide and 160 meters long, probably caused by a landslide after a strong earthquake. In order to get to the Škrila, we will have to ‘trespass’ on private property, so remember not to compromise it in any way – especially not by skipping over or demolishing the drywall, or disturbing sheep.</p><br>
                <p>Above the blueness, it is almost just the starkness of the stone. On the Kornati excursion, you will have an opportunity to see monuments of human labor – dry stone walls. Hundreds of meters of drywalls, handmade artifacts, were erected in the late 19th century. They were built to o preserve the property, but also to protect the pasture and prevent sheep from moving from one property to another. The interesting fact is that all walls were built just as high as it is necessary to prevent sheep from jumping over them and crossing to someone, yet just as wide as needed to prevent the wind from destroying them.</p><br>
                <p>The first confirmed colonization of the Kornati dates to the Illyrians who began building small square forts on the island. They were mainly herders but fishing also had an important role in their economy. Apart from sheep breeding, Illyrians also engaged in fishing, so the dwellings served both as a place to live and as a storehouse. Illyrian forts are now a valuable historical heritage whose number speaks of the good population of the island at that time.</p><br>
                <p>Lojena is the only sand beach on the Kornati islands and a real source of biodiversity. The whole area of the Kornati islands is attractive for divers – the only ones who know the story of all the colors of the depths below the Kornati cliffs. Don’t forget to bring your snorkeling gear! Kornati underwater is pristine and transparent because the light penetrates deep into it, creating a unique habitat for fish and various colorful corals. Thanks to its underwater world, the Kornati teems with nautical activities, notably diving and snorkeling.</p><br>
