                <h1>Drage: A Hidden Adriatic Gem Where the Sea Meets Tranquility and Nature!</h1>
                <h2>Drage</h2>
                <p class="description">What is in Drage</p> <br>
                <p>Drage is located in the central part of the Croatian Adriatic and is situated on the isthmus between Vransko Lake and the Adriatic Sea, belonging to the peripheral area of Ravni Kotari. The most significant natural feature of Drage is its highly indented coastline and numerous bays— draga, both on the sea and lake shores, which is where the name of the settlement originates.</p><br>
                <p>The marina has been open since June 2024.Drage Bay is an oasis of peace and natural beauty located between Zadar and Šibenik.The indented coastline, clear sea, and numerous islets represent a paradise for sailors. </p><br>
                <p>Drage was founded by the inhabitants of Pakoštane and was historically considered a part of Pakoštane, both under ecclesiastical and secular authorities. This is supported by statistical data and historical sources, which rarely distinguish between Pakoštane and Drage.It was only in the first half of the 20th century that Drage began to be regarded as a separate settlement, a distinction that was solidified with the establishment of the Parish of St. Anthony of Padua in 1978.</p><br>
                <p>Dolaška Draga is a beach located near the village of Drage, at the border between Zadar and Šibenik-Knin counties. The beach is particularly attractive due to its pebble shoreline, which gently slopes into the sea, making it ideal for swimming with young children.For a full-day stay during peak season, it is best to walk from the village to secure a good spot under the sun. Parking near the beach is available, but finding a spot can be challenging in high season.</p><br>
                <p>In addition to its pebble section, the beach also has rocky areas, and a small marina with local boats extends from the shore. Nearby, you will find shops and restaurants, offering refreshments beyond the natural shade provided by the lush pine forest that stretches over the beach.If you have rented an apartment, room, or holiday house in Drage or the surrounding area, be sure to explore other nearby beaches, such as Porat Beach and Oaza Mira, or enjoy a swim in secluded, intimate coves along the coastline.</p><br>
